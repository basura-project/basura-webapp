# Time Series Forecasting Models: LSTM and Time LLM

This repository contains implementations of time series forecasting models using both LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Time LLM (Large Language Model).

## Models Included:
- **LSTM**: A standard LSTM model for time series forecasting.
- **Time LLM**: A cutting-edge time series forecasting model using a Large Language Model (LLM).

## How to Run:
- **Time LLM**: To run the Time LLM model, execute the main script `main_script.ipynb`. This will guide you through the forecasting process using the Time LLM model.

## Future Work:
- **Prompt Bank**: Developing a prompt bank to enhance the versatility and accuracy of the Time LLM model.
- **Exploring Other LLMs**: Experimenting with different Large Language Models to see their effectiveness in time series forecasting with Time LLM.

### LSTM Model Enhancements:
- Future work will focus on making the LSTM model more complex and robust, potentially by adding more layers, exploring different architectures, or integrating advanced techniques.

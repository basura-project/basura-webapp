As Basura, a company committed to responsible and efficient waste management with a focus on environmental sustainability, public health, and community well-being, we seek to forecast future waste generation trends. The dataset provided includes the following columns: 'Metal,' 'Plastic,' 'Organic,' 'Paper,' 'Hazardous,' and 'E-Waste.' Each column represents a category of waste managed by our company, recorded over time. Our objective is to predict the future quantities of these waste categories to optimize our waste management strategies, minimize environmental impact, maximize resource recovery, and protect public health. Please provide a forecast based on the historical data available, taking into account seasonal trends, regulatory changes, and any external factors that may influence waste generation in these categories.
